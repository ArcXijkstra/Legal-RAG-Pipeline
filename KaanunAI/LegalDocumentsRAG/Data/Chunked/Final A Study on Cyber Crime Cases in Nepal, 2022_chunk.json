However, when we look into Nepal\u2019s history of internet, the change is even more rapid. We went from a country with 10% people being able to access to internet to 68% within a decade. While this has led to positive changes, this rapid development has also opened up Pandora\u2019s Box. It has always seemed that the Nepalese legal system and Nepal\u2019s law is playing catchup with technology and Nepal\u2019s law has not been able to address various problems related to cyberspace, cyber security et al. The researchers here have looked into these problems, specifically, the problems faced by the Judiciary while trying to solve issues pertaining to cyberspace.",

The researcher believes that the final paper will provide the readers with knowledge of cybercrimes prevalent in Nepal, cyber laws cases of Nepal, how these cases are adjudicated in Nepal and the attitude to judiciary in Cyber law cases.",

Moreover, in our day today life like banking transection, shopping, bill payment, online services mail correspondence, etc. has made our life easy and comfortable. However, while using this useful invention, there is high risks and threats as well. Various cyber related crimes such as vishing, phishing, hacking, cyber extortion, data breach, identity theft, harassment, defamation, stalking, fraud and so on have become a serious problems and are quiet challenging also. They are sometime against people, sometime against properties and even sometimes against Government. Because of its complex nature, it is very difficult to determine these cases during investigation and prosecution and also in the court as well while making decision. The cyber-crime is not only a national problem, but this problem is also challenging in the international arena.",

The report is detailed and analytical on the concept and ideas of the cybercrime, its types, existing legal instruments, nature, trends and working mechanism in the field of cybercrime cases in Nepal. At the very outset, I would like to congratulate the researcher Advocate Mr. Ashankan Malla and Advocate Mr. Rastra Bimochan Timalsena for their hard work and dedication in making this incredible research report.

As of January 2021, there were 4.66 billion active internet users worldwide - 59.5 percent of the global population.1 Of this total, 92.6 percent (4.32 billion) accessed the internet via mobile devices, with 4.2 billion active social media users.2 Along with this development, new threats to digital infrastructures and opportunities for misuse of cyberspace have emerged, affecting individuals, society, and governments alike.",

This denotes a 73.8% penetration rate of internet users out of its total population. Further, there are around 12.3 million Facebook users in Nepal,5 the most popular online social media platform globally. Such a rise in Internet users would inevitably increase criminal activities as Internet platforms provide criminals with anonymity coupled with distance proximity.

Still, due to the development and proliferation of the information technology framework in Nepal, the internet has reached the majority of the places in Nepal. Prior to 2008, offences relating to cybercrimes were dealt with by the Muluki Ain, Some Public (Crime and Punishment) Act 2027, and the Telecommunications Act 1997. However, as cases related to cyber offences became prominent and pressing, there was a need for a law to govern cyber law issues specifically. As such, the ETA 2063 BS was introduced and promulgated on 24th Bhadra 2063."

            "Another issue to deal with is jurisdictional challenges. Cybercrime is a transboundary crime where a cyber-attack can originate in one country but impact another country. The issue of jurisdiction is fundamental to all legal systems worldwide, as Nepal has been facing nowadays. One of the major issues regarding jurisdiction is that courts generally do not have jurisdiction beyond their boundaries. In that event, the only way to get the accused/perpetrator to Nepal is through extradition, which comes with its complex challenges.",
            "In cybercrime cases, without identifying the perpetrator first, the case does not proceed. When a crime originates from abroad, the task of identification becomes especially hard. Furthermore, gathering data and evidence requires coordination with offices from foreign countries. For example, suppose a crime of online defamation was carried out via Facebook. In that case, the police must wait to verify content from Facebook Headquarters located in the United States as there is no Facebook office in Nepal. The same goes for other social media sites such as Instagram, YouTube, or Tiktok. Moreover, in many countries, crimes relating to social media offences are not under the mandate of cybercrimes, and thus these companies are hesitant to release the data with urgency. Differences in language, culture, attitude and perception of different countries regarding what constitutes cybercrimes are hindrances to effective investigations.",

            "cybercrimes. For example, during the lockdown due to Covid-19 in 2020, several complaints were filed regarding deep fake pornographic videos targeting Nepali actresses and celebrities circulated online; however, it was found that the videos originated from India and other foreign jurisdictions. Therefore, the perpetrator could not be identified, and no action was taken as the case could not be pursued further. As such, jurisdictional challenges extend to identifying perpetrators outside of Nepal, tracking and tracing the IP address, and further barriers of language, culture, and attitude. The solution to these jurisdictional challenges lies in international cooperation alone. Thus, Nepal should endeavour to become a signatory of the Budapest Convention and other international treaties that deal with cross-border cybercrimes."

            "While examining the challenges relating to trends of the judiciary in the adjudication of cybercrime cases, enforcement of punishments in cybercrime cases has also been identified as a major weak spot. On the one hand, the cyber law in Nepal seems harshly punitive as most of the accused are convicted, even when the nature of the crime itself is not that serious. Similarly, not enough penalty is imposed on the guilty person, as most are let go with meagre fines and minimum sentencing. It has been observed that there is no uniformity in sentencing in the trial court. Due to a lack of laws and a lack of proper understanding of the subject matter of cybercrimes, imprisonment or fines \u2013 including compensation \u2013 are generally imposed on the lower side. As discussed earlier, the maximum punishment for the person convicted of cybercrime in Nepal is three years, with the exception of Section 47, where punishment is up to five years. However, the sentence imposed is between fifteen days to one month, whereas the fine imposed is between fifteen to fifty thousand rupees. In many cases, judges simply",
            "impose minimum punishment because they are under pressure to punish due to the possibility of backlash from media or law practitioners.",
            "The data shows that in over fifty percent of cases of punishment, there was no imprisonment imposed against the perpetrators. They were punished with a minimum fine. The table below provides the information."

As mentioned earlier, jurisdiction in relation to complaint filing is given to the Metropolitan Police, the Cyber Bureau, and the CIB. However, the lack of clear distinction sometimes creates confusion about where such cases are to be filed and who has the final jurisdiction to record and investigate such cases. For instance, in a cybercrime case against a foreign national woman in Nepal, she was incessantly harassed online with several false and baseless materials published via Facebook and other online news portals. When the complaint was first made at the Metropolitan Police, Teku, she was told to go to the Cyber Bureau. However, the Bureau did not entertain and register her case as they claimed that the case falls under the purview of defamation and must therefore be filed directly at the Kathmandu District Court instead. Cases of similar nature or even of lesser degree have been allowed under ETA by the police. This arbitrary setup has led to doubts in the minds of people over whether the ETA is simply used as a tool by the police to control cyberspace or exists to give some protection to people against cybercrimes.",
            "Even if a case gets registered with the police, not all cases see the light of day. Last year, there were over 2301 complaints filed at the Cyber Bureau alone. However, only 57 cases were registered in the Court. Similarly, in the year before that, there were 357 complaints filed, of which 52 cases were registered in the Court. This is because not all the complaints filed merit the charge of a cybercrime offence. Since the general public understands that all offences originating online or through the computer system are cybercrimes, several unrelated or unnecessary complaints are made.",
            "Furthermore, unlike other criminal cases, an FIR is not directly lodged in cybercrime cases. Instead, first, a simple application is made, after which the police commence its preliminary investigation. Then, the formal complaint is made once an accused is identified. As such, lack of users\u2019 awareness and education; a lack of clear demarcation in relation to the investigative authority; difficulties in identifying and locating perpetrator; along with the discretionary powers of the investigative authorities to determine what is and what is not a cybercrime offence leaves the door open for errors and misuse of the ETA, especially considering the weak and insufficient legal and regulatory mechanisms. the"

Effective prosecution and adjudication of cases require clear and cohesive laws, i.e., rules must be expressed in understandable terms, with as little room as possible for ambiguity or uncertainty. To solve the challenges faced due to the ambiguous and vague construction of the ETA, the first and foremost offences deemed to be cybercrimes must be properly laid down and defined in law. As such, the offences provided under Chapter 9 of the ETA need a clear definition with necessary explanations so that there will not be room for misinterpretation or misuse of the law; thereby, law enforcement becomes consistent and harmonious.",

This Section needs to be broken down and explained in a manner where people understand what constitutes the term \u2018publication\u2019, whether such publication must be made in the public domain, and the effects and implications of such publication, i.e., whether the publication results in defamation, blackmailing, harassment, social media crimes, or any other offence. The Supreme Court of Nepal, in the case of the Government of Nepal v. Hari Panta,97 has already interpreted the term \u2018publication\u2019 in such a manner that private conversations done through an electronic medium are not deemed to be a publication and therefore denied personal conversations as \u2018publication\u2019 resulting in defamation or insult or reputation in the context of Section 47 of the ETA. Therefore, it is important that this judgement is disseminated amongst lawyers and judges and enforced this case law in lower courts to eliminate the confusion regarding publications of illegal content online. This Section, however, needs further explanations to combat private domain publications causing blackmailing, threats, or harassment to any individual.",

Section 66A of the Information Technology Act, 2000 A.D made it a punishable offence for any person to send 'grossly offensive' or 'menacing' information using a computer resource or communication device.98 The provision also made it punishable to persistently send information that the sender knows to be false for annoyance, inconvenience, danger, obstruction, insult, injury, criminal intimidation, enmity, hatred, or",

For the same reason, Nepal should also consider repealing or, at the very least, modifying the language of Section 47 of the ETA.",
            "Furthermore, the meaning and scope of the other offences and the nature of such offences under the Act need refinement and explanations so that crimes relating to piracy, hacking, unauthorized access, and fraud can be included. For instance, under Section 44 of the ETA, the scope of piracy must be expanded beyond computer source code and extend to other forms of computer and information systems, such as data, electromagnetic devices, and computer networks, and should also include digital art, movies, and photograph piracy. Similarly, under Section 52 of the ETA, committing computer fraud must clearly mention whether offences relating to fake profiles, false identity, phishing, and other online theft and frauds are included under this law. Moreover, since most of the cybercrime offences committed in Nepal are technology/computer-related crimes, such crimes can be tried under traditional criminal laws such as harassment, defamation, theft, fraud, blackmailing, etc. This creates a situation wherein law practitioners and courts are unsure whether certain offences committed online are to be tried and punished as cybercrimes under the ETA or relevant criminal law provisions.

According to esteemed cybercrime lawyer Mr. Baburam Aryal, in addition to amending the law by defining and broadening the scope of certain Sections, it is also important to classify various offences under the ETA into different punitive regimes. To consider all crimes under the ETA, they must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt; instead of categorizing all crimes under ETA to be deemed as schedule-1 offences, the Act should be amended to classify these offences based on the nature and gravity of offence into - i) civil offences; ii) crime against the state; iii) and a crime against an individual; and proceed accordingly. This classification of offences seems to deter the scope for misuse of cyberspace and the law while at the same time making adjudication easier and also lessening the burden on a single court by reducing the caseload of the Kathmandu District Court."

Therefore, it is of paramount importance to establish the Information Technology Tribunal as envisaged by the ETA itself, as it provides for a three-member tribunal consisting of one member from the field of law, Information Technology, and Commerce. This allows specialization in the subject matter of the Tribunal to handle proceedings and adjudicate cases with a certain degree of expertise. The Supreme Court of Nepal, in the case of Advocate Rajaram Shrestha v. The Government of Nepal,101 has already ordered the Government to establish the IT Tribunal. However, as discussed in the above Chapter, merely establishing the Information Technology Tribunal may not solve all the problems in prosecuting and adjudicating cybercrime cases. This Tribunal is likely to face the same issues being faced by the Kathmandu District Court, such as overburden of cases and limited access to justice due to the continued centralized jurisdiction of the Tribunal. The solution for this challenge is to establish Regional Benches of the Centralized Tribunal, which will function as the Principal Bench, acting as the administrative headquarters while also trying cases within its specified jurisdiction.",

Another way to ease the burden of this Court is to assign cybercrime cases to those judges with technical expertise and knowledge in the concerned subject matter. And in the event of a judge transfer, they are to be placed in the Kathmandu District Court. In an interview with Honourable Judge Shri Krishna Bhattarai, assigning cybercrime cases to a small group of judges will allow familiarity to breed in and learn about the nuances of cybercrime issues, making them experts in this area.

This law is over 15 years old in dire need of revamping as there has been substantial developments and changes in the field of modern technology \u2013 most social media and online platforms widely used today were created in the last fifteen years or so. With provisions relating to piracy, hacking, unauthorized access, illegal publication online, and computer fraud, the ETA acknowledges certain cyber threats albeit in a limited manner only. However, the language in the law is vaguely drafted leading to ambiguity in interpretation and enforcement of law.

The introduction of the ICT Policy, 2072 and CERT Guidelines, 2075, as well as the proposed draft IT Bill and CC Bill, itself acknowledges the fact that there is a need for revision of the existing cybercrime laws.",

It is important to note that a vast majority of cybercrime cases in Nepal are committed against women thus highlighting the need for safe space for women online. Despite the best efforts of the Kathmandu District court, its centralized jurisdiction means all such cases nationwide are being tried in a single court thus limiting access to justice and overburdening the Court.

Increasing knowledge and capacity of judges, lawyers, and police through trainings, advanced digital forensics, adequate infrastructures, proper procedures for collecting and handling of evidence, are some of the areas that require immediate impact. The unique and sensitive nature of evidence in cybercrime cases is such that its search, seizure, and examination by an investigator who is not familiar with such subject-matter, more often leads to an inefficient investigation. Therefore, calling upon cyber forensic experts to collect and present digital evidence remains imperative. To have a set of handbooks, guidelines, rules, and laws in this regard is thus a dire need in this area.
