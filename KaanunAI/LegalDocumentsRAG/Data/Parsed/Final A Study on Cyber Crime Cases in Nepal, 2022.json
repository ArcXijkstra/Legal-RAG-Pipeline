While this has led to positive changes, this rapid development has also opened up Pandora\u2019s Box. It has always seemed that the Nepalese legal system and Nepal\u2019s law is playing catchup with technology and Nepal\u2019s law has not been able to address various problems related to cyberspace, cyber security et al. The researchers here have looked into these problems, specifically, the problems faced by the Judiciary while trying to solve issues pertaining to cyberspace.",

Further, I would like to extend sincere thanks to Deputy Executive Director Hon. Kedar Paudel, Faculty/District Judge Dr. Diwakar Bhatta, Director Mr. Shreekrishna Mulmi and Deputy Director Mr. Sanjib Rai and entire NJA team for their guidance, feedback, inputs and patience to shape the research paper in its present form. I hope the paper will be a mile milestone in the area of the cyberspace and cyber-crime in the Nepali context.",

Still, due to the development and proliferation of the information technology framework in Nepal, the internet has reached the majority of the places in Nepal. Prior to 2008, offences relating to cybercrimes were dealt with by the Muluki Ain, Some Public (Crime and Punishment) Act 2027, and the Telecommunications Act 1997. However, as cases related to cyber offences became prominent and pressing, there was a need for a law to govern cyber law issues specifically. As such, the ETA 2063 BS was introduced and promulgated on 24th Bhadra 2063.",

The complex nature of cybercrimes makes them different from other conventional crimes, and as such, it requires careful examination with a certain degree of expertise. With its limited resources in terms of manpower, knowledge, and technical knowledge, Nepal is not exempted from the threat of cybercrimes and is witnessing a steady incline in the number of such crimes. It is therefore important to identify and highlight the challenges faced by the criminal justice system at various stages, i.e., from registration of complaints to the investigation, prosecution, and adjudication of cases, so that we may understand the underlying problems existing in the legal regime and, consequently, find solutions that bridge the gap so identified, leading to proper and effective implementation and enforcement of cybercrime laws in Nepal.",

In other words, the person can be put behind bars, thereby curtaining their personal and civil liberties. Furthermore, there are no provisions in the law regarding compensation for wrongful arrests. Such tactics for suppressing free speech and making a false prosecution threaten democracy. Keeping in view all these, the Kathmandu District Court judges have underscored the need for separate cybercrime legislation in Nepal. They all agree that the present ETA does not cover all aspects of cybercrimes, and thus separate legislation is needed to meet the demands of the modern-day. They suggest that the same can be done by meeting international standards in this regard. They further express an urgent need to establish the Information Technology Tribunal as per the Act. Moreover, many cases have not entered the Supreme Court, and thus, proper precedents through the right interpretation are yet to be given.

Furthermore, even when a proper investigation is done by the cyber security personnel, there are other challenges like presentation of the evidence in court during prosecution. Due to inadequate IT infrastructure and dedicated technicians in the courtroom along with budgetary constraints and other problems as highlighted in this chapter, presenting of evidence by the forensic expert or security personnel is not as clear or cohesive as it should otherwise be which may lead to misinformed adjudication of certain cases.",

On the one hand, the cyber law in Nepal seems harshly punitive as most of the accused are convicted, even when the nature of the crime itself is not that serious. Similarly, not enough penalty is imposed on the guilty person, as most are let go with meagre fines and minimum sentencing. It has been observed that there is no uniformity in sentencing in the trial court. Due to a lack of laws and a lack of proper understanding of the subject matter of cybercrimes, imprisonment or fines \u2013 including compensation \u2013 are generally imposed on the lower side. As discussed earlier, the maximum punishment for the person convicted of cybercrime in Nepal is three years, with the exception of Section 47, where punishment is up to five years. However, the sentence imposed is between fifteen days to one month, whereas the fine imposed is between fifteen to fifty thousand rupees. In many cases, judges simply",

However, the lack of clear distinction sometimes creates confusion about where such cases are to be filed and who has the final jurisdiction to record and investigate such cases. For instance, in a cybercrime case against a foreign national woman in Nepal, she was incessantly harassed online with several false and baseless materials published via Facebook and other online news portals. When the complaint was first made at the Metropolitan Police, Teku, she was told to go to the Cyber Bureau. However, the Bureau did not entertain and register her case as they claimed that the case falls under the purview of defamation and must therefore be filed directly at the Kathmandu District Court instead. Cases of similar nature or even of lesser degree have been allowed under ETA by the police. This arbitrary setup has led to doubts in the minds of people over whether the ETA is simply used as a tool by the police to control cyberspace or exists to give some protection to people against cybercrimes.",

Effective prosecution and adjudication of cases require clear and cohesive laws, i.e., rules must be expressed in understandable terms, with as little room as possible for ambiguity or uncertainty. To solve the challenges faced due to the ambiguous and vague construction of the ETA, the first and foremost offences deemed to be cybercrimes must be properly laid down and defined in law. As such, the offences provided under Chapter 9 of the ETA need a clear definition with necessary explanations so that there will not be room for misinterpretation or misuse of the law; thereby, law enforcement becomes consistent and harmonious.",

The Supreme Court of Nepal, in the case of the Government of Nepal v. Hari Panta,97 has already interpreted the term \u2018publication\u2019 in such a manner that private conversations done through an electronic medium are not deemed to be a publication and therefore denied personal conversations as \u2018publication\u2019 resulting in defamation or insult or reputation in the context of Section 47 of the ETA. Therefore, it is important that this judgement is disseminated amongst lawyers and judges and enforced this case law in lower courts to eliminate the confusion regarding publications of illegal content online. This Section, however, needs further explanations to combat private domain publications causing blackmailing, threats, or harassment to any individual.",

To consider all crimes under the ETA, they must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt; instead of categorizing all crimes under ETA to be deemed as schedule-1 offences, the Act should be amended to classify these offences based on the nature and gravity of offence into - i) civil offences; ii) crime against the state; iii) and a crime against an individual; and proceed accordingly.

        "text": "Another major problem identified during this research is regarding the issue of centralized jurisdiction of the Kathmandu District Court and the lack of human resource capacity or necessary skill and knowledge of the judges to handle the cybercrime cases adequately. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to establish the Information Technology Tribunal as envisaged by the ETA itself, as it provides for a three-member tribunal consisting of one member from the field of law, Information Technology, and Commerce. This allows specialization in the subject matter of the Tribunal to handle proceedings and adjudicate cases with a certain degree of expertise. The Supreme Court of Nepal, in the case of Advocate Rajaram Shrestha v. The Government of Nepal,101 has already ordered the Government to establish the IT Tribunal. However, as discussed in the above Chapter, merely establishing the Information Technology Tribunal may not solve all the problems in prosecuting and adjudicating cybercrime cases. This Tribunal is likely to face the same issues being faced by the Kathmandu District Court, such as overburden of cases and limited access to justice due to the continued centralized jurisdiction of the Tribunal. The solution for this challenge is to establish Regional Benches of the Centralized Tribunal, which will function as the Principal Bench, acting as the administrative headquarters while also trying cases within its specified jurisdiction.",

It is, therefore, very important to prioritize and provide basic training to all judges of the Kathmandu District Court, especially with regard to digital evidentiary value and validity of evidence. Another way to ease the burden of this Court is to assign cybercrime cases to those judges with technical expertise and knowledge in the concerned subject matter. And in the event of a judge transfer, they are to be placed in the Kathmandu District Court. In an interview with Honourable Judge Shri Krishna Bhattarai, assigning cybercrime cases to a small group of judges will allow familiarity to breed in and learn about the nuances of cybercrime issues, making them experts in this area. For instance, cases relating to offences against children are always assigned to the Chief Judge of the respective District Courts.",

It is important to note that a vast majority of cybercrime cases in Nepal are committed against women thus highlighting the need for safe space for women online. Despite the best efforts of the Kathmandu District court, its centralized jurisdiction means all such cases nationwide are being tried in a single court thus limiting access to justice and overburdening the Court. This issue is further compounded by the limited knowledge and technical expertise amongst the judges and court officers around cybercrime laws.

Increasing knowledge and capacity of judges, lawyers, and police through trainings, advanced digital forensics, adequate infrastructures, proper procedures for collecting and handling of evidence, are some of the areas that require immediate impact. The unique and sensitive nature of evidence in cybercrime cases is such that its search, seizure, and examination by an investigator who is not familiar with such subject-matter, more often leads to an inefficient investigation. Therefore, calling upon cyber forensic experts to collect and present digital evidence remains imperative. To have a set of handbooks, guidelines, rules, and laws in this regard is thus a dire need in this area.
