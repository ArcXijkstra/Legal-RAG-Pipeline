The main objective of that Policy is to make information technology accessible to the general public and increase employment, to build a knowledge-\u2010based society and to establish knowledge-\u2010based industries. With the large development of Information Technology the criminal activities are also increasing so to control those criminal acts and make the digital communication and data secured the Cyber Law came into it's existence. In Nepal also Cyber crime like Software Piracy, Hacking etc. are increasing. Corruption is seen in every field. Big government and some private organizations are using pirated CDs. Even some security organizations responsible for taking action against this crime are seen as violating the rules. Software CDs can be seen in the footpaths of Kathmandu, which has decreased the value, as well as violated the newly implemented law of the country. People are crowding into these places because the price is low. People want just the CDs. Who cares about the quality and law? Program CDs of great value are found all over the Kathmandu valley and prices range from Rs. 50-\u2010 100 (U.S.$0.70 -\u20101.40). Though this is not new to any Nepali citizen, it may attract the attention of some foreigners visiting Nepal. \u201cForeigners are taking numerous pirated software CDs back to their countries\u201d, said one Footpath CDs seller in Kathmandu. This problem is not limited to CDs. Even in Cybercafes, children of young ages can be seen using porn sites. The proprietor of the Cafe, not caring about the law, just wants all his computers to be packed. Different hacker software can be found in each individual's computer. Whenever anyone buys a new software CD, it is shared with all his friends and relatives. So, it has",

In most countries around the world, however, existing laws are likely to be unenforceable against such crimes. This lack of legal protection means that businesses and governments must rely solely on technical measures to protect themselves from those who would steal, deny access to, or destroy valuable information. Self-\u2010protection, while essential, is not sufficient to make cyberspace a safe place to conduct business. The rule of law must also be enforced. Countries where legal protections are inadequate will become increasingly less able to compete in the new economy.

In today\u2019s world Cyber crime is a big challenge for security personals. Cyber crime consists of specific crimes dealing with computers and networks (such as hacking, stealing) and the facilitation of traditional crime through the use of computers (child pornography, hate crimes, telemarketing /Internet fraud). In addition to cyber crime, there is also \u201ccomputer-\u2010supported crime\u201d which covers the use of computers by criminals for communication and document or data storage. While these activities might not be illegal in and of themselves, they are often invaluable in the investigation of actual crimes. Computer technology presents many new challenges to social policy regarding issues such as privacy, as it relates to data mining and criminal investigations. Here are the some mostly happened Cyber crimes in our Cyberspace:-\u2010 1.2.1 Hacking Hacking in simple terms means an illegal intrusion into a computer system and/or network. There is an equivalent term to hacking i.e. cracking, but from most of the Laws perspective there is no difference between the term hacking and cracking. Every act committed towards breaking into a computer and/or network is hacking. Hackers write or use ready-\u2010made computer programs to attack the target computer. They possess the desire to destruct and they get the kick out of such destruction. Some hackers hack for personal monetary gains, such as to stealing the credit card information,",

Prevention measures help you to stop unauthorized users (also known as \u201cintruders\u201d) from accessing any part of your computer system. Detection helps you to determine whether or not someone attempted to break into your system, if they were successful, and what they may have done. 1.4.3 Use Strong Password For each computer and service you use (e-\u2010mail, chatting, online purchasing, for example), you should have a strong password.",

A quarter reported theft of proprietary information and 69% reported theft of laptop computers. Ninety percent (90%) reported virus contamination and a staggering 97% reported systems abuse by insiders (pornography, pirated software, inappropriate email usage, etc.). According to Sex tracker, an organization that tracks the on line pornography trade, seventy percent (70%) of on line pornography viewing occurs during the 9-\u20105 workday. Although some companies have instituted rudimentary email usage policies, most have neglected to address all aspects of computers in the workplace and information security. Although the best-\u2010 crafted policies may not stop an employee bent on violating them, good policies will minimize their opportunities and minimize the organization's liability. Organizations of all sizes often suffer from the same computer and information security problems, many of which are easy to correct. Individuals trying to gain access to your computer systems and data often exploit these security holes. This guide will discuss these and how proper policies and procedures can plug these holes. Perhaps the most common threat to organizations comes from viruses, worms, and other hostile programming code. While it may be impossible to completely guard against all such threats, following the policies set forth in this manual will minimize the threat potential. The steps include educating your users to the threats, setting out policies that minimize the infection potential, installing anti virus software, regularly updating the anti virus software, and installing all of the security patches for operating systems, web browsers, email clients, and applications.",

While they may appear redundant, they serve to reinforce the absolute lack of privacy. Courts have generally ruled in the favor of employers where policies made it clear that the employee had no expectation of privacy. The Courts and federal regulators have generally left employers to regulate personal computer, Internet, and email usage as the employer wishes. You should be aware, however, of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). The Depression-\u2010era National Labor Relations Act protects workers who are communicating about work terms and conditions; this includes union activity, salary, sick time, and vacation time. While in 1988 the NLRB upheld the firing of an employee that sent an email critical of layoffs, where the email was sent at a busy time of the day and disrupted the companies computer system, in 1998 they ordered a company to rehire an employee that was fired for criticizing a leave policy via email. The difference in the two cases, other than the political time frame, appears to be that the first worker physically disrupted his employer's business. The second employer did not physically disrupt the business, but angered management by criticizing a new policy. The NLRB General Counsel's Office has issued an opinion memorandum stating that an employer cannot ban employee use of email for messages that are federally protected under labor law. For purposes of policies, employers may wish to consider the federally protected communications as work related, not personal use. If your organization is unionized, you should consult with a knowledgeable attorney before implementing any policies that might affect union employees.",

Legal experts are working in this field to help educate and guide the Internet community on crime prevention and the reporting of Cyber crimes.

The effective implementation of Cyber law will be a necessity. Nepal will not be able to regulate the information technology industries without taking the international legal context into account. The main thing is that regulations are enforced. First of all, the authorities should be self-\u2010concerned before awaking the citizens. There still needs a lot of homework to be done if Nepal expects a boom in the IT sector. Anyway this law has provided new trust to the Information Technology (IT) sector, and computer and IT professionals are hopeful that it will create a favorable situation for conducting IT business. It contains a strong provision of punishment against Cyber crimes according to the nature of the crime. As per the provisions of law, the government is fully authorized to punish Cyber criminals -\u2010-\u2010 both an individual or institution.
